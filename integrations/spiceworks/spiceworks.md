# SIGNL4 Integration with Spiceworks

Spiceworks is a free cloud-based help desk and network monitoring solution designed specifically for systems administrators and IT professionals. The solution helps in managing tickets raised by clients, providing customer support via email.

SIGNL4 intercepts those emails and delivers them to the on-call members to quickly address the issue. Just one single user created in Spiceworks can send open ticket alerts to your entire SIGNL4 team, ensuring that the is acknowledged and responded to in a timely manner. Without SIGNL4, tickets may go unread in emails and issues may go unresolved.

First create a user. Under Settings click on Employee Administration. Add a team member with the SIGNL4 email address.

Once tickets are opened and assigned to the SIGNL4 team ALL team members will receive the alert no matter where they are.
