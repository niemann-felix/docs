# SIGNL4 Integration with SAP

It is not possible for a mobile worker to sit in front of a SAP dashboard and actively monitor company issues that arise. SIGNL4 enables SAP solutions to notify the mobile teams in the field or on call in real-time. This speeds up response significantly increases operational efficiency.

With a simple email you can deliver SAP data and information to field workers and mobile workforces.

Just configure whatever SAP system you use to send emails to the SIGNL4 team email address.

The alert in SIGNL4 might look like this.
