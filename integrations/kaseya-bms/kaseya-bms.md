# SIGNL4 Integration with Kaseya BMS

Whether you are an MSP or an IT professional, everything is about speed of response and fulfilling your customers SLAs. The communication of any service ticket, is as important as detecting it. Your technicians or engineers need to immediately know that there is a new issue and they need to be able to action upon it. When serving customers on a 24/7 basis, SIGNL4 gives you peace of mind while not in front of your computer or while on-call after hours. Service tickets make it to the right people in time and accountability and visibility across different teams and stakeholders increases significantly.

SIGNL4 pulls detailed ticket information from [Kaseya BMS](https://www.kaseya.com/), providing a smooth and seamless integration experience by offering a built-in 2-way connector. Based on the information retrieved, we trigger automated workflows linking such information to the responsible engineers or technicians, enabling them to interact and respond, feeding status updates, assignments and work notes back into Kaseya BMS.
