# SIGNL4 Integration with Slack

The SIGNL4 Slack App connects your Slack channels with your SIGNL4 team and all events and alerts that SIGNL4 processes.

The SIGNL4 app for Slack provides:

- Notifications about new SIGNL4 alerts in the Slack channels
- Notifications in the Slack channels when SIGNL4 alerts are confirmed, annotated, or closed

The SIGNL4 app also allows to:

- Change your duty status in SIGNL4
- Trigger new SIGNL4 alerts to your operations team
- Acknowledge or close SIGNL4 alerts from within a Slack channel

To link the app with Slack you need to enter your SIGNL4 credentials.
