# SIGNL4 Integration with AWS IoT Button

The [AWS IoT Button](https://aws.amazon.com/iotbutton/) is a useful tool for daily operations on the shop floor or in the field. Set a custom command to be triggered when the button is pressed, and integrate it with your SIGNL4 team to get immediate, actionable alerts when disaster strikes.

See the video below and more about this integration on our [blog](https://www.signl4.com/blog/setup-configuration-aws-iot-button/).
