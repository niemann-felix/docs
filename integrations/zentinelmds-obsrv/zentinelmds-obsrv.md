# SIGNL4 Integration with ZentinelMDS Obsrv!

SIGNL4 mobile alerting and incident response solution for powerful alerting, alert management and for mobile assignment of work items. Get the app at [https://www.signl4.com](https://www.signl4.com/).

The integration is realised via Node-RED, which runs on Obsrv!. You can use the existing [SIGNL4 Nodes](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-signl4) for this. A more detailed description of the integration of SIGNL4 with Node-RED can be found [here](https://www.signl4.com/?portfolio_item=node-red_mobile_alerting&noredirect=en_US).
