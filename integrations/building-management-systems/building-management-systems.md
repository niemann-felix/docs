# SIGNL4 Integration with Building Management Systems

In case of critical situations in [building management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_management_system) or facility management, it is important to alert the responsible persons quickly and reliably, no matter where they are.

SIGNL4 reliably delivers the right information to the right people like service technicians, facility managers, etc. at the right time â€“ anywhere. It notifies active staff on duty through targeted and persistent mobile push, SMS text and voice calls with acknowledgement, tracking and escalation.

SIGNL4 provides standard interfaces for integration with building management systems.

In building management systems you can find various protocols and interfaces like C-Bus, Profibus, Profinet, DeviceNet, SOAP, XML, BACnet, LonWorks, Modbus, KNX, etc.

Please contact us at hello [@] signl4.com and we will be happy to help you find the best way to integrate with your systems.
