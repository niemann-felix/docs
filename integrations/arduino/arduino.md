# SIGNL4 Integration with Arduino

The integration of Arduino and SIGNL4 is done by sending an HTTP Post request.

## Prerequisites
- A SIGNL4 account ([https://www.signl4.com](https://www.signl4.com/))
- A Arduino board and an Arduino account ([https://www.arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/))

There are various options to send HTTP Post requests from Arduino. We use the code sample fromÂ [ArduinoJson](https://arduinojson.org/v6/how-to/use-arduinojson-with-httpclient/). You can use the following code whenever you want to send an alert to your SIGNL4 team, for example when sensor value reaches a certain threshold.

```javascript
// Alert data (JSON)
DynamicJsonDocument data(2048);
data["Title"] = "Arduino Alert";
data["Message"] = "Temperature too high.";
data["Temperature"] = "4";

// Serialize JSON document
String json;
serializeJson(data, json);

HTTPClient http;

// Send request to SIGNL4
// Replace "team-secret" with your SIGNL4 team secret
http.begin("https://connect.signl4.com/webhook/team-secret");
http.POST(json);

// Read response
Serial.print(http.getString());

// Disconnect
http.end();
```

## Test it

That is it and now you can test the alert. You can do so by running the above code on your Arduino board. As a result you will receive an alert in your SIGNL4 app.

The alert in SIGNL4 might look like this.
