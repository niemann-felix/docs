# SIGNL4 Integration with Microsoft Teams

SIGNL4 is a solution to reliable alert and notify operational teams in the field about critical incidents in IT, IoT and industrial systems. It adds mobile alerting capabilities to your services and systems in no time. SIGNL4 bridges the ‘last mile’ from IT systems, machines and sensors to engineers, IT staff and workers ‘in the field’ and thus provides for an up to 10x faster response to critical alerts, major incidents and urgent service requests.

Upon critical events it notifies team members reliably through persistent mobile push, text and voice calls with acknowledgement, tracking and escalation. Through convenient interfaces like email and webhooks, SIGNL4 adds mobile alerting and incident response capabilities to IT, IoT, SCADA and other technical systems.
