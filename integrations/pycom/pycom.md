# SIGNL4 Integration with Pycom

IoT sensors and devices like Pycom allow users to build their monitoring capabilities how they chose. Do not let those notification sit on a desktop dashboard when you know SIGNL4 can pull the data with a simple script. Take your IoT monitoring on the go with this simple integration.

Visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/signl4/s4-iot-pycom) page for an example Python script that will connect your Pycon IoT device with your SIGNL4 team. Watch our video on [Pycom with Azure IoT](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=pRqpKZ7mO1s) to see how Pycom connects to a platform and then to SIGNL4.

The alert in SIGNL4 might look like this.
