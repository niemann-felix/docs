# SIGNL4 Integration with Schneider Electric

SIGNL4 is an out-of-the-box cloud solution that enables operations and business teams to respond faster and more effectively to critical alerts, major incidents and urgent service requests.

SIGNL4 reliably delivers the right information to the right people at the right time â€“ anywhere. It notifies active staff on duty through targeted and persistent mobile push, SMS text and voice calls with acknowledgement, tracking and escalation.

SIGNL4 enables technical systems in IoT, on the shop floor and in hundred other areas to connect and communicate with the right people. It ensures alert visibility beyond the dashboard, i.e. on mobile devices (BYOD) with clear alert indication and enables true workforce mobility, e.g. on the shop floor, the campus and more. You can integrate SIGNL4 easily via webhook, REST API or simply via email.

SIGNL4 provides standard interfaces for integration with Schneider Electric systems.
