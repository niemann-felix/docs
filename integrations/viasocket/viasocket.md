SIGNL4 is a mobile alert notification app for powerful alerting, alert management and mobile assignment of work items. Get the app atÂ [https://www.signl4.com](https://www.signl4.com/).

## Prerequisites

- A [SIGNL4](https://www.signl4.com/) account
- A[ViaSocket](https://viasocket.com/) account

## How to Integrate

In ViaSocket you create a new flow, e.g. triggered by a webhook. In your flow you add SIGNL4. There are two actions available:
**Send Alert**: Triggers an alert in SIGNL4.  
**Resolve Alert**: Closes a previously triggered alert in SIGNL4. You need to make sure to use the same External ID.

You can test the activities directly within the configuration page.

## Test it

That is it. Now you can save the flow and test it. You should then receive an alert on your SIGNL4 app.

The alert in SIGNL4 might look like this.
