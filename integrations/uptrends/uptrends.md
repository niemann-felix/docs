# SIGNL4 Integration with Uptrends

In our example we are using Uptrends to monitor the up-time of critical servers.  We are forwarding website down alerts via webhook to our SIGNL4 team.

SIGNL4 is a mobile alert notification app for powerful alerting, alert management and mobile assignment of work items. Get the app at [https://www.signl4.com](https://www.signl4.com)

## Prerequisites
- A SIGNL4 ([https://www.signl4.com](https://www.signl4.com)) account
- An Uptrends ([https://uptrends.com](https://uptrends.com)) account

## How it works

Letâ€™s customize a webhook integration within Uptrends to make sure that we are sending an alerts that are raised to our SIGNL4 team. From the Main Menu, select Alerts and then choose Integrations.

On Integrations page, you will enter the Type of Uptrends Integration and give it a name.

On the customizations tab leave the Method as POST and enter the webhook URL for your SIGNL4 team. The rest of the defaults can be left as is.

Saving this integration will now allow you to add this Integration to an Alert Definition. To do this select Alerts > Alerting Definitions > Default Alert.  Make sure to check the box for the Custom Integration created earlier.

Now, the next time the websites that are monitored are unavailable, SIGNL4 will receive the alert data via webhook and notify your on-call team.
